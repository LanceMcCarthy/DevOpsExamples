## What This Reference Is For

Use this file when the user needs lifecycle, activation, notification, packaged vs unpackaged, or runtime initialization guidance that goes beyond plain XAML UI work.

## Prefer

- Learning the scenario from the matching WindowsAppSDK sample before designing an abstraction.
- Packaged deployment when it fits the product constraints.
- Explicit unpackaged guidance when the user has an installer, external-location requirement, or expects repeatable direct executable launches during development.

## Avoid

- Mixing packaged and unpackaged guidance in one answer without stating which path applies.
- Treating deployment requirements as optional details.
- Re-implementing lifecycle behavior already covered by Windows App SDK APIs.
- Using package-identity-dependent APIs in unpackaged startup code without an explicit guard or replacement path.

## Guidance

- Use AppLifecycle guidance and samples for activation, instancing, restart, and state notifications.
- Use notifications samples for push or app notifications rather than inventing custom delivery logic.
- For packaged apps, account for framework-dependent deployment and runtime package requirements.
- For unpackaged apps, account for bootstrapper and runtime initialization requirements.
- For unpackaged apps, treat package identity as absent unless the app deliberately establishes it through the chosen deployment model.
- Keep storage, settings, and startup services aligned with the deployment model. If a service assumes packaged storage or activation, redesign it before local unpackaged verification.
- Explain the deployment model before giving build or publish steps.

## Review Checklist

- Is the app's deployment model explicit?
- Are lifecycle and activation behaviors using platform APIs rather than ad hoc workarounds?
- Are notification requirements matched to the correct sample and runtime guidance?
- Does the recommendation match packaged or unpackaged constraints?
