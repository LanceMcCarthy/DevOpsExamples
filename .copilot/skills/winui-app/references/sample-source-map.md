| Check whether a PC can build WinUI apps | `../SKILL.md` | `foundation-environment-audit-and-remediation.md` |
| Install missing prerequisites | `../SKILL.md` | `foundation-environment-audit-and-remediation.md` |
| Start a new packaged or unpackaged app | `../SKILL.md` | `foundation-setup-and-project-selection.md` |
| Choose packaged vs unpackaged | Learn Windows App SDK deployment docs | WindowsAppSDK-Samples `Samples/Unpackaged` |
| Build a shell with navigation | WinUI Gallery navigation pages | Learn navigation basics |
| Design a custom title bar | Learn title bar guidance | WinUI Gallery title bar samples |
| Add Mica or system backdrops | Learn Mica guidance | WindowsAppSDK-Samples `Samples/Mica` |
| Design a settings page | WinUI Gallery control pages | CommunityToolkit `SettingsControls` |
| Pick a control for a list or collection | WinUI Gallery control pages | Learn responsive/layout guidance |
| Improve accessibility | Learn accessibility docs | WinUI Gallery standard control behavior |
| Diagnose responsiveness | Learn `winui-perf.md` | WPR/WPA guidance in `testing-debugging-and-review-checklists.md` |
| Add notifications or activation flows | WindowsAppSDK-Samples | Learn Windows App SDK lifecycle docs |
| Decide whether to add CommunityToolkit | `community-toolkit-controls-and-helpers.md` | Toolkit component directories |

## Source Preferences

- Learn first for requirements and behavioral guidance.
- WinUI Gallery first for concrete control usage and shell composition.
- WindowsAppSDK-Samples first for scenario APIs and platform integration.
- CommunityToolkit only when the task clearly requires Toolkit-specific functionality.
